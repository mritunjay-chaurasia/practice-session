1- How do you secure REST APIs built with Express.js?
    Use JWT authentication.
    Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    Use Helmet and CORS properly.
    Apply rate limiting.
    Validate data using Joi or Zod.

2. Explain how middleware works in Express.js.
    Middleware functions are functions that have access to req, res, and next objects. They execute code, modify requests/responses, or end the request-response cycle.

3. What are the benefits of using TypeScript in Node.js?
    Type safety reduces runtime errors.
    Easier refactoring and maintainability.

4. Advantage of using express.js
    a- Simplified web developement
    b- flexible routing system
    c- Middleware support
    d- Template engine integration

5- Purpose of app.use() used to execute funtion globally
6- Request Pipeline in express :
   It is a series of middleware function that handle incomming HTTP request and pass control to the next function
7- CORS (Cross origin resource sharing): Browser block frontend javascript code from making request from one port to another port 
8- REST APIs => (Representational State Transform) Application programming Interface are architectural style for designing networked application . It is stateless and follow protocol of http or https. format like json and xml
SOAP API => Simplified Object Access protocol and follow protoco http or smtp and have state or stateless 

9- Libuv library: Provides a thread pool and handles background tasks like file system operations and networking.

10- Non-blocking I/O: Lets Node.js process thousands of concurrent requests efficiently without creating multiple threads

 11- What are some popular alternatives to ExpressJS?
    There are several popular alternatives to ExpressJS which includes:
    Koa.js
    Hapi.js
