1- How do you secure REST APIs built with Express.js?
    Use JWT authentication.
    Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    Use Helmet and CORS properly.
    Apply rate limiting.
    Validate data using Joi or Zod.

2. Explain how middleware works in Express.js.
    Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can modify them or terminate the request cycle. Example uses: authentication, logging, error handling, and data parsing.

3. What are the benefits of using TypeScript in Node.js?
    Type safety reduces runtime errors.
    Easier refactoring and maintainability.

4. Advantage of using express.js
    a- Simplified web developement
    b- flexible routing system
    c- Middleware support
    d- Template engine integration

5- Purpose of app.use() used to execute funtion globally
6- Request Pipeline in express :
   It is a series of middleware function that handle incomming HTTP request and pass control to the next function
7- CORS (Cross origin resource sharing): Browser block frontend javascript code from making request from one port to another port
