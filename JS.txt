1- Types of Data types
    There are two types of Data Types
    a- Primitive Data Types:- Primitive types are immutable (cannot be changed)
        Number, Boolean, String, Undefined, Null, BigInt
    b- Non Primitive Data Types:- These are objects and stored by reference.
        Object, Array,Function

2- Difference b/w setTimeout and setInterval
    a- setTimeout: Runs once after a given delay.
                setTimeout(()=>{
                   console.log(Executes the callback only one time.)
                },1000)
    b- setInterval: Runs repeatedly after a given delay.  
                setInterval(()=>{
                    console.log(Executes the callback repeatedly)
                },2000) 

3- Make a function that behave same as setInterval
